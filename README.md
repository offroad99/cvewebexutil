# cvewebexutil
Utility for Cisco's Webex product line to perform simple functions.

The first function the utility is able to perform is to remove a user from all rooms/spaces you have in common which you have rights to modify membership of.
The included scripts can be run from the CLI using Python or can be hosted on a server using Python flask for now. Yes, yes, flask is not a production product.
Also, this is not a production application. It is a tool.
